;; `kotoba/smtp/message.kotoba` against `smtp.protocol`.
;;
;; The slice is what a message IS: who it addresses, what headers it
;; carries, and what has to happen to its body before it can go inside DATA.
;; Three rules here are the reason this is product semantics and not
;; plumbing, and each has a test named after it below —
;;
;;   * a Bcc is a recipient and never a header;
;;   * a body line beginning with "." has to be doubled, or it ends the
;;     message early (RFC 5321 §4.5.2);
;;   * the same address named twice is one RCPT TO.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest
;; (require-graph). Nothing but this file notices the two drifting apart.
