;; `kotoba/smtp/protocol_core.kotoba` against `smtp.protocol`.
;;
;; The object exists so a guest can decide SMTP success and SASL pick with
;; neither a JVM nor Node present. It cannot call this namespace, so nothing
;; but this notices the two drifting apart.
;;
;; The SASL table is checked harder than the rest: every combination of
;; advertised mechanisms and credentials, not a sample. A sampled parity
;; test agrees with a table it never visited. The trap that looks like
;; "empty AUTH" but is actually "only GSSAPI" is in that product.
