;; `kotoba/smtp/protocol_response.kotoba` against `smtp.protocol/response-line`.
;;
;; The slice is reply-line structure: three digits, one separator, text.
;; ADR-2608650000 decision 6 says a design that scans with a regular
;; expression gets the design change before the migration, not a wait for
;; regex to be admitted. RFC 5321 4.2 fixes the first four octets, so the
;; parse is positional and needs no scan at all.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest
;; (require-graph). Nothing but this file notices the two drifting apart.
;;
;; The negative control is `separator-swap-must-go-red`: a guest that reads
;; "-" as final inverts multiline continuation. It asserts the mutation
;; actually changed the emitted value BEFORE asserting disagreement, so a
;; guest broken some other way cannot be counted as the control firing.
