;; Command lines are product semantics: strings, not a judgement table.
;; The guest cannot require this namespace, so nothing but this notices
;; the two drifting apart. `.cljc` stays the oracle; this file does not
;; load `.kotoba` from production code.
;;
;; One-branch mutation is in `ehlo-line-refuses-a-helo-guest`: a guest
;; that emits HELO must not pass as EHLO. Reader-broken source is not
;; that test.
