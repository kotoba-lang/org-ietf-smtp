;; `kotoba/smtp/protocol.{kotoba,cljk}` against `smtp.protocol` -- the ESMTP
;; capability surface (RFC 1869 / 1870) and the SASL payload framing (RFC 4616 /
;; XOAUTH2).
;;
;; The guest is positional where the oracle returns a map and a set: a map cannot
;; be a Kotoba return type, so `parse-extensions` becomes `extension-value` +
;; `has-extension?` + `extension-count` and `auth-mechanisms` becomes
;; `mechanism-count` + `advertises-mechanism?`. Parity therefore means the
;; positional answers agree with what the oracle's map and set say, over the same
;; block. That is a stronger comparison than a shape check: it is the only place
;; that notices the two drifting apart, in either direction.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest (require-graph).
;;
;; The negative control is `keeping-the-greeting-must-go-red`: the greeting line
;; is line 0 of an EHLO reply and is not an extension, and a guest that keeps it
;; answers TRUE for the server's own domain. That was a real defect in this
;; component before it landed. The control asserts the mutation actually changed
;; the emitted value BEFORE asserting disagreement, so a guest that fails to
;; compile, or fails for another reason, is not counted as the control firing.
