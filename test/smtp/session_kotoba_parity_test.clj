;; `kotoba/smtp/session.kotoba` against `smtp.client/send-mail!`.
;;
;; The slice is the mail transaction: MAIL FROM, one RCPT TO per recipient,
;; DATA, the body. The guest is an application — state in, one reply line in,
;; next state and one inert line out — so the oracle and the guest are driven
;; by the SAME script and compared on what went on the wire, which recipients
;; were accepted, which were refused, and what a failure says.
;;
;; `init` takes the message itself and composes its own body through
;; `smtp.message`, so both sides start from the same value and the oracle's
;; `mime-message`/`dot-stuff` are compared through what reaches the wire.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle and is not required from the guest
;; (require-graph). Nothing but this file notices the two drifting apart.
;;
;; The negative control is `partial-refusal-must-not-become-total-failure`:
;; the one rule in `send-mail!`'s docstring that a careless port loses.
