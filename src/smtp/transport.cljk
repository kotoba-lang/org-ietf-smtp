(ns smtp.transport
  "The wire boundary for SMTP (RFC 5321): a 4-fn `Transport` protocol
  (write!/read-line!/read-n!/close!) that `smtp.client` drives and every
  other namespace in this library is blind to. The real transport
  (`tls-connect`) is JVM-only (a raw `SSLSocket`, implicit TLS on port 465
  -- SMTP Submission over TLS, matching this org's existing
  `MANIMANI_SMTP_URL=smtps://...:465` convention); tests inject a fake
  in-memory `Transport` instead.

  Deliberately not shared code with `org-ietf-imap`'s identically-shaped
  `imap.transport` -- same structural idea, different protocol, kept
  independent per this org's grab-bag-library convention (see this
  library's ADR-0001).")
