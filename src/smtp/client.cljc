  set by the caller, since it is the same across every send on one
  connection.

  **Every recipient goes in one transaction.** This used to take a single
  `:to` and send once, which meant a caller with three recipients either
  dropped two or opened three transactions — and three transactions is
  three separate messages, each with only its own recipient in the header,
  so nobody can see who else received it and a reply-all goes to one
  person. RFC 5321 §3.3 is explicit that a mail transaction has one MAIL
  FROM and *one or more* RCPT TO.

  `:raw` sends a prebuilt RFC 5322 message instead of `mime-message`'s
  minimal one — for a caller that has already composed headers this
  library does not model (MIME parts, Content-Transfer-Encoding, RFC 2047
  encoded-words in the subject).

  A recipient the server refuses does not abort the send: RFC 5321 §3.3
  allows some RCPT TO commands to fail while others succeed, and the
  message is delivered to those that were accepted. Returns `session` with
  `:accepted` and `:rejected` so the caller can tell which happened —
  throwing on the first refusal would turn a partial success into a total
  failure and lose the mail that did go out. All recipients refused is a
