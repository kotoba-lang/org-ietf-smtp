;; `kotoba/smtp/protocol.kotoba` against a REAL EHLO response, and against the
;; fuel budget that decides how it has to be written.
;;
;; ## Why this exists next to `kotoba -M test`
;;
;; `-M test` runs the component's `test-*` exports on jvm-kir, js AND wasm, which
;; is the only evidence that it works on the runtime it ships to. But the harness
;; runs the whole suite in ONE module instance, and an instance has 512 fuel
;; units charged per FUNCTION ENTRY (`let fuel=512` in the emitted artifact;
;; amu's `fuel_estimate.cljc` calls it a function-entry charge model). One
;; `extension-value` over a real 175-character EHLO block costs roughly 250, so a
;; suite that touches a real block more than twice cannot fit however the tests
;; are split -- the budget belongs to the SUITE.
;;
;; So the in-language tests use a small block and say IT RUNS EVERYWHERE, and this
;; script instantiates a FRESH module per call, uses the real Gmail EHLO response,
;; and says IT IS RIGHT. Neither claim substitutes for the other: a green
;; `-M test` alone is not evidence that this component can parse an EHLO reply.
;;
;; ## What it does NOT do
;;
;; This is not the repository's parity standard. That is a JVM test compiling the
;; guest to KIR and executing it against `smtp.protocol` with a mutation control
;; (`test/smtp/protocol_response_kotoba_parity_test.clj` is the pattern), plus a
;; `.cljk` twin. Both are OWED for this component and are named in its header.
;; The expected values below were transcribed from the oracle by hand, which is
;; weaker: it catches drift in the guest and not drift in the oracle.
;;
;; Usage (needs the kotoba CLI on PATH; skips loudly if it is absent):
